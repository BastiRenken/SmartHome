# SmartHome
A private Smart Home project using Telegram to communicate with a Raspberry Pi.

I want to control the door and the garage door from my smartphone.
Additionally I want to learn how to use GitHub.

To use the program you need:
- a Telegram bot
- the token of the bot
- your Chat-ID
- the Chat-ID of the other users
